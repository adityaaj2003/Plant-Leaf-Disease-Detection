We used CNN to train the model and aftr tarining the model we built a web appliaction with the help of StreamLit.
##CNN:
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model particularly effective for image recognition and classification tasks. CNNs are composed of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The convolutional layers apply filters to the input image to detect various features, such as edges, textures, and patterns, which are crucial for identifying objects within the image. Pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, making the computation more efficient and reducing the risk of overfitting. Fully connected layers, typically found at the end of the network, use the extracted features to make final classification decisions. In plant leaf disease detection, CNNs can accurately identify different diseases by learning intricate patterns in the leaf images, thus aiding in early and precise diagnosis. The ability of CNNs to automatically learn and optimize features from raw pixel data without the need for manual feature extraction makes them a powerful tool in various image-related applications.
##StreamLit
Streamlit is an open-source app framework specifically designed for creating and sharing data science and machine learning applications. With Streamlit, developers can build interactive web applications quickly and with minimal effort, using pure Python. It simplifies the process of creating user interfaces by providing intuitive, high-level APIs for adding widgets, such as sliders, buttons, and text inputs. This allows users to easily adjust parameters and visualize changes in real-time. Streamlit's seamless integration with Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib makes it a powerful tool for data analysis and visualization. Additionally, Streamlit supports rapid prototyping, enabling data scientists to transform their models and data into deployable applications swiftly. The resulting applications are interactive, highly customizable, and can be shared with stakeholders for better collaboration and decision-making.
